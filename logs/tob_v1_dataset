100,"what is software testing","Software testing is an activity of software engineering whose main goal is to validate the project requisites and to assert the software correctness, both before the deployment of the final product as well as during its maintenaice."
100,"what is structural testing","Structural testing (or White-Box testing) is a technique in which tests are derived from the knowledge of the software's structure or internal implementation. That way, the testing professional is able to check if a specific part of the code is correct. Unit testing is an instance of structural testing."
100,"what is a software technique","Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?"
100,"what is system testing","System testing is a level of software testing where a complete and integrated software is tested. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the system’s compliance with the specified requirements."
100,"what is unit testing","Unit testing verifies the functioning in isolation of software elements that are separately testable. Depending on the context, these could be the individual subprograms or a larger component made of highly cohesive units. Typically, unit testing occurs with access to the code being tested and with the support of supporting tools. The programmers who wrote the code typically, but not always, conduct unit testing."
100,"what is integration testing","Integration testing is the process of verifying the interactions among software components. Classical integration testing strategies, such as top-down and bottom-up, are often used with hierarchically structured software."
100,"Can you give me an example of equivalence class partitioning","Here is an example of an application of equivalence partitioning. Consider the following specification: one of the fields of a form is a text box that accepts numeric values from 18 to 25. For this problem, a value that belongs to an invalid equivalence class is 17, whereas a value belonging to a valid equivalence class is, for instance, 20."
100,"How do I apply equivalence class partitioning","The equivalence partitioning criterion divides the input domain in several subsets (partitions) with no intersection and selects a test case for each partition. The idea is that each test case represents all input domain that partition class and, therefore, one test case for each class is enough for this testing criterion. The criterion considers valid and invalid equivalence classes. For example, you can separate invalid and valid inputs into two different subsets or classes."

100,"what is a test case","A test case is composed by the test input, the execution conditions and the expected output to be produced by the program."
100,"what is a oracle","An oracle is any human or mechanical agent that decides whether a program behaved correctly in a given test and accordingly results in a verdict of “pass” or “fail.” There exist many different kinds of oracles; for example, unambiguous requirements specifications, behavioral models, and code annotations. Automation of mechanized oracles can be difficult and expensive."

10,"What´s functional testing?","Functional testing or black-box testing is a type of testing which checks if a program or system is working correctly only by comparing the expected outputs with the output of the program. The professional responsible for doing the test activity does only know the possible input and output values for the program, but has no knowledge of the source code or internal structure of the program or software."
10,"How to apply cause-effect graphing?","I don't know how to respond this"
10,"How to apply equivalence partitioning?","The equivalence partitioning is done dividing the input set in several subsets with no intersecction (i.e. a partition) and creating a test case for each representative of the subsets. For example, you can separate invalid and valid inputs into two different subsets."

111,"How do i apply equivalence class partitioning criteria","The equivalence partitioning criterion divides the input domain in several subsets (partitions) with no intersection and selects a test case for each partition. The idea is that each test case represents all input domain that partition class and, therefore, one test case for each class is enough for this testing criterion. The criterion considers valid and invalid equivalence classes. For example, you can separate invalid and valid inputs into two different subsets or classes."

111,"Can you give me a example of functional testing criteria","In functional testing technique, the functionality of an application is tested by providing inputs to generate the desired outputs. Consider a bus ticket purchase system with the following requirement: The discount amount is calculated as follows: students can purchase up to 100 tickets per month, with a 50% discount; workers can buy up to 50 tickets a month, with a 30% discount; other users do not have discount on the ticket price. The functional testing concentrates in selection of test input (or data test) to test this functionality, for instance, selecting test input for each class of user of the bus (student, worker and others)."

12,"How to generate a test case","It depends on the criterion used. The equivalence partitioning is done dividing the input set in several subsets with no intersecction (i.e. a partition) and creating a test case for each representative of the subsets. For example, you can separate invalid and valid inputs into two different subsets. The boundary-value analysis determines the boundaries for input values and selects the extremes of the boundary to use in a test case.

155,"what is functional testing","Functional testing (or Black Box Testing) is a technique whereby the system is tested against the functional requirements/specifications. During the functional testing the internal logic of the system being tested is not known to the tester. Functional testing ensures that the requirements are properly satisfied by the system. This type of testing is not concerned with how processing occurs, but rather, with the results of processing. It simulates actual system usage but does not make any system structure assumptions. Functional testing is normally performed during the levels of System Testing and Acceptance Testing."
155,"what is unit testing","Unit testing verifies the functioning in isolation of software elements that are separately testable. Depending on the context, these could be the individual subprograms or a larger component made of highly cohesive units.

The idea is that each test case represents all input domain that partition class and, therefore, one test case for each class is enough for this testing criterion. The criterion considers valid and invalid equivalence classes. For example, you can separate invalid and valid inputs into two different subsets or classes."

This type of testing is not concerned with how processing occurs, but rather, with the results of processing. It simulates actual system usage but does not make any system structure assumptions. Functional testing is normally performed during the levels of System Testing and Acceptance Testing."
205,"What are the functional testing criteria","A testing criteria or technique is a set of rules which define the information to be used to create a test set, in order to fulfill some objective. For example, the white-box testing uses the information of the code’s structure to create a test set."
205,"Give me an example of functional testing criteria","In functional testing technique, the functionality of an application is tested by providing inputs to generate the desired outputs. Consider a bus ticket purchase system with the following requirement: The discount amount is calculated as follows: students can purchase up to 100 tickets per month, with a 50% discount; workers can buy up to 50 tickets a month, with a 30% discount; other users do not have discount on the ticket price. The functional testing concentrates in selection of test input (or data test) to test this functionality, for instance, selecting test input for each class of user of the bus (student, worker and others)."

22,"How do i apply equivalence class partitionig criteria?","I don't know how to respond this"
22,"Can you give me an example of functional testing criteria?","In functional testing technique, the functionality of an application is tested by providing inputs to generate the desired outputs. Consider a bus ticket purchase system with the following requirement: The discount amount is calculated as follows: students can purchase up to 100 tickets per month, with a 50% discount; workers can buy up to 50 tickets a month, with a 30% discount; other users do not have discount on the ticket price. The functional testing concentrates in selection of test input (or data test) to test this functionality, for instance, selecting test input for each class of user of the bus (student, worker and others)."
22,"How do I apply equivalence class partitioning criteria?","The equivalence partitioning criterion divides the input domain in several subsets (partitions) with no intersection and selects a test case for each partition. The idea is that each test case represents all input domain that partition class and, therefore, one test case for each class is enough for this testing criterion. The criterion considers valid and invalid equivalence classes. For example, you can separate invalid and valid inputs into two different subsets or classes."
22,"What is an input domain?","The input domain is a set of values that can be used to execute a certain program. The input domain specifies all the possible sets of values."

51,"what is functional testing?","Functional testing (or Black Box Testing) is a technique whereby the system is tested against the functional requirements/specifications. During the functional testing the internal logic of the system being tested is not known to the tester. Functional testing ensures that the requirements are properly satisfied by the system. This type of testing is not concerned with how processing occurs, but rather, with the results of processing. It simulates actual system usage but does not make any system structure assumptions. Functional testing is normally performed during the levels of System Testing and Acceptance Testing."

52,"What is a Boundary value analysis?","Boundary_value_analysis is a functional testing criterion which test data are chosen on or near the boundaries of the input domain of variables, with the underlying rationale that many faults tend to concentrate near the extreme values of inputs. An extension of this technique is robustness testing, wherein test cases are also chosen outside the input domain of variables to test program robustness in processing unexpected or erroneous inputs."
52,"How to use Boundary value analysis?","The boundary-value testing criterion determines the boundaries for input values and selects the extremes of the boundary to generate test cases. For instance, if a program's valid input is a positive number less than 10, then the following test cases will be selected in order to test the boundaries: 0, 1, -1, 10, 9 and 11."
52,"Another example of Boundary value analysis?","Suppose you have a program in which the user has to create a password with length between 6 and 12. So the test cases generated for this program, using the boundary value analysis technique, would be for passwords with lengths 5, 6, 12 and 13."
52,"another example of Boundary value analysis?","Suppose you have a program that grants access to a certain web page only if you are 18 years old or older. So a boundary value analysis criteria used for this program would generate test cases for age inputs of 17 and 18"

93,"Can you give me a example of functional testing criteria","In functional testing technique, the functionality of an application is tested by providing inputs to generate the desired outputs. Consider a bus ticket purchase system with the following requirement: The discount amount is calculated as follows: students can purchase up to 100 tickets per month, with a 50% discount; workers can buy up to 50 tickets a month, with a 30% discount; other users do not have discount on the ticket price. The functional testing concentrates in selection of test input (or data test) to test this functionality, for instance, selecting test input for each class of user of the bus (student, worker and others)."
93,"how do i apply equivalence class partitioning criteria","The equivalence partitioning criterion divides the input domain in several subsets (partitions) with no intersection and selects a test case for each partition. The idea is that each test case represents all input domain that partition class and, therefore, one test case for each class is enough for this testing criterion. The criterion considers valid and invalid equivalence classes. For example, you can separate invalid and valid inputs into two different subsets or classes."

96,"what is a test data","The test data (or test input) is the input data and the parameters associated with a specified test case."
96,"how to use limit value analysis","The boundary-value testing criterion determines the boundaries for input values and selects the extremes of the boundary to generate test cases. For instance, if a program's valid input is a positive number less than 10, then the following test cases will be selected in order to test the boundaries: 0, 1, -1, 10, 9 and 11."

96,"how to use equivalence classes criteria","The equivalence partitioning criterion divides the input domain in several subsets (partitions) with no intersection and selects a test case for each partition. The idea is that each test case represents all input domain that partition class and, therefore, one test case for each class is enough for this testing criterion. The criterion considers valid and invalid equivalence classes. For example, you can separate invalid and valid inputs into two different subsets or classes."
96,"what is equivalence partitioning","Equivalence partitioning is a functional testing criterion that involves partitioning the input domain into a collection of subsets (or equivalent classes). Data in each partition must behave the same way therefore only one condition needs to be tested. Similarly, if one condition in a partition doesn’t work, then none of the others will work."
