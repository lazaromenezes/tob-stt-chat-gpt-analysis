1316,165,what is a software test,"A test, in software testing, is the act of performing some assurance of both the correctness of a software and its validation of the project requisistes.",whQuestion,"A software test is a process of evaluating the functionality, performance, and quality of a software system or application. It involves running the software under controlled conditions to identify any defects, errors, or bugs that may affect its proper functioning. Software testing is performed to ensure that the software meets the specified requirements, works as intended, and delivers the expected results. It includes various techniques such as manual testing, automated testing, unit testing, integration testing, system testing, regression testing, and acceptance testing. The primary goal of software testing is to improve the reliability and usability of the software before it is released to the end-users."
2816,94,What is software testing activity,I don't know how to respond this,whQuestion,"Software testing activity is a process of evaluating a software application or system to detect any defects or errors and ensure its quality. It involves the execution of software components or systems under specific conditions to verify its functionality, performance, security, and reliability. The main purpose of software testing is to identify and fix bugs or issues before the software is deployed to end-users. Some common activities in software testing include test planning, test design, test execution, defect tracking, and test report generation."
223,111,what is fault,"Fault is an incorrect step, process, or data definition in computer program. Fault is the formal name of a bug.",whQuestion,"A fault refers to a fracture or a break in the Earth's crust, where rocks on either side move relative to each other. Faults are caused by the tectonic forces that occur within the Earth, which result in the movement of the Earth's plates. There are several types of faults, including normal faults, reverse faults, and strike-slip faults. Faults can cause earthquakes, as the energy released during the movement of the rocks can lead to shaking of the ground."
2370,63,what is software testing?,"Software testing is an activity of software engineering whose main goal is to validate the project requisites and to assert the software correctness, both before the deployment of the final product as well as during its maintenaice.",whQuestion,"Software testing is a process of evaluating a software product or system to ensure that it meets specified requirements and functions as intended. It involves executing the software with various inputs, comparing the actual results to expected results, and identifying any discrepancies or defects. The primary goal of software testing is to uncover problems or errors in the software and provide confidence in its quality, reliability, and performance before it is released to end-users. Testing can be performed through various techniques such as manual testing, automated testing, functional testing, performance testing, security testing, and usability testing, among others."
2237,52,What is a Boundary value analysis?,"Boundary_value_analysis is a functional testing criterion which test data are chosen on or near the boundaries of the input domain of variables, with the underlying rationale that many faults tend to concentrate near the extreme values of inputs. An extension of this technique is robustness testing, wherein test cases are also chosen outside the input domain of variables to test program robustness in processing unexpected or erroneous inputs.",whQuestion,"Boundary value analysis is a black-box software testing technique that involves selecting test cases based on the boundaries of input and output values. The purpose of this technique is to test if the application handles data correctly at the lower and upper boundaries of valid input or output ranges.

The boundaries in boundary value analysis are usually the minimum and maximum values specified in the requirements or specifications. Test cases are then created to test the behavior of the software at, just below, and just above these boundaries.

For example, if a system accepts numeric input between 1 and 100, a boundary value analysis would test values like 1, 2, 100, 99, and 101. The objective is to verify if the system behaves correctly at the limits and near the limits of the valid input range.

Boundary value analysis is effective in identifying potential defects that might occur due to incorrect handling of boundary conditions, rounding errors, or off-by-one errors. It helps ensure that the software works correctly and is able to handle extreme values at the boundaries of valid input or output ranges."
1891,25,what is a test?,I would do a search for it.,whQuestion,"A test is an assessment tool or method used to evaluate a person's knowledge, skills, abilities, or other characteristics in a specific subject or field. Tests can take various forms such as written exams, oral exams, practical demonstrations, or computer-based assessments. They are commonly used in educational institutions, professional settings, or various selection processes to measure someone's level of understanding or proficiency in a particular area."
1977,28,what is a functional test?,Does it have anything to do with tests?,whQuestion,"A functional test is a type of software testing that focuses on testing the functionality of an application or system. It involves testing various functionalities of the software to ensure that it is working as expected and meets the requirements specified. Functional tests are typically black-box tests, meaning the testers do not have knowledge of the internal code or structure of the software being tested. These tests are designed to simulate real-world scenarios and validate that the software performs its intended functions correctly. Functional tests can be performed manually or automated using testing frameworks or tools."
104,105,what is a failure,A failure is a result of the program which is incorrect or not expected. This is caused by an error.,whQuestion,"A failure is a lack of success in achieving a desired goal or objective. It refers to a situation where efforts, plans, or actions have not resulted in the desired outcome or expected results. Failure can occur in various aspects of life, such as relationships, education, career, business, or personal endeavors. It is an experience that can provide valuable lessons and growth opportunities, helping individuals learn from their mistakes and make improvements in the future."
132,106,What is a software error,An error is a state of execution of the program which is not expected and may lead to an incorrect result.,whQuestion,"A software error, also known as a bug, is a flaw or defect in a software program that causes it to produce unexpected or incorrect results. These errors can occur during the development, execution, or maintenance of a software application. Software errors can range from minor glitches that have minimal impact on the program's functionality to critical issues that can cause crashes, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities. Testing, debugging, and regular software updates are typically done to identify and fix these errors."
304,115,What is a test case,"A test case is composed by the test input, the execution conditions and the expected output to be produced by the program.",whQuestion,"A test case is a specific set of conditions or inputs that are used to exercise a particular aspect or functionality of a software application. It is designed to verify whether the software behaves as expected or not. A test case typically includes a description of the inputs, the expected outcome, and any preconditions or assumptions that need to be met. Test cases are used by software testers to systematically test the functionality, reliability, and performance of a software application. They help identify defects in the software and ensure that it meets the requirements and specifications."
