Seeker: what is error
TOB-STT: An error is a state of execution of the program which is not expected and may lead to an incorrect result.

Seeker: hi
TOB-STT: Hello, ask me a question!
Seeker: what is omission in testing
TOB-STT: Software testing is an activity of software engineering whose main goal is to validate the project requisites and to assert the software correctness, both before the deployment of the final product as well as during its maintenaice.
Seeker: say me an example of omission test
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: could you explain me an example of omission testing
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: could you explain me an example of omission
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: exampple of Omisson error
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: could you explain me an example of omission fault
TOB-STT: A defect is an incorrect data definition. In your code, it could be an access of inexistent position in a vector, for instance.
Seeker: clear
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what is the diference of fault and failure
TOB-STT: A failure is a result of the program which is incorrect or not expected. This is caused by an error.
Seeker: Software Error
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what is Software Error
TOB-STT: An error is a state of execution of the program which is not expected and may lead to an incorrect result.
Seeker: what is Software Fault
TOB-STT: Fault is an incorrect step, process, or data definition in computer program. Fault is the formal name of a bug.
Seeker: what is a fuctional test
TOB-STT: A test, in software testing, is the act of performing some assurance of both the correctness of a software and its validation of the project requisistes.

TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what is unit testing
TOB-STT: Unit testing verifies the functioning in isolation of software elements that are separately testable. Depending on the context, these could be the individual subprograms or a larger component made of highly cohesive units. Typically, unit testing occurs with access to the code being tested and with the support of supporting tools. The programmers who wrote the code typically, but not always, conduct unit testing.
Seeker: what are the phases of testing
TOB-STT: Software testing is an activity of software engineering whose main goal is to validate the project requisites and to assert the software correctness, both before the deployment of the final product as well as during its maintenaice.
Seeker: what is integration testing
TOB-STT: Integration testing is the process of verifying the interactions among software components. Classical integration testing strategies, such as top-down and bottom-up, are often used with hierarchically structured software.

TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what is software fault
TOB-STT: Fault is an incorrect step, process, or data definition in computer program. Fault is the formal name of a bug.
Seeker: where is software faults
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?

TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what is equivalence partitioning
TOB-STT: Equivalence partitioning is a functional testing criterion that involves partitioning the input domain into a collection of subsets (or equivalent classes). Data in each partition must behave the same way therefore only one condition needs to be tested. Similarly, if one condition in a partition doesnâ€™t work, then none of the others will work.
