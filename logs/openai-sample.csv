2094,2094,38,What are the partitioning criteria?,Try searching the Wikipedia.,whQuestion,"Partitioning criteria are used to determine how to divide a dataset into subsets or partitions based on specific characteristics or attributes. Some common partitioning criteria include:

1. Range-based partitioning: Dividing the dataset based on a predetermined range or specific values of a single attribute. For example, dividing a list of ages into partitions such as 0-10, 11-20, etc.

2. Size-based partitioning: Dividing the dataset into partitions of equal or approximate size. This criteria ensures that each partition contains a similar number of records.

3. Distribution-based partitioning: Dividing the dataset based on the distribution of a particular attribute, aiming to create partitions with similar distributions. This criterion can be useful in ensuring that outliers or extreme values are not concentrated in a single partition.

4. Similarity-based partitioning: Dividing the dataset based on the similarity or dissimilarity of the records. This criterion is often used in clustering analysis to group similar data points together.

5. Hierarchical partitioning: Dividing the dataset based on a hierarchical structure or attribute relationships. For instance, partitioning a dataset of geographical regions based on their levels of hierarchy, such as country, state, and city.

6. Attribute-based partitioning: Dividing the dataset based on specific attributes or features. This criterion involves selecting one or more attributes that are believed to be relevant for the partitioning and creating subsets accordingly.

These partitioning criteria can vary depending on the specific context or problem being addressed. The choice of partitioning criteria is crucial as it affects the quality and accuracy of subsequent analysis or processing performed on the partitions.","Partitioning criteria are the conditions or rules used to divide a larger dataset or population into smaller subsets or partitions. These criteria may be determined based on a number of factors such as age, geographical location, income level, or any other measurable characteristic depending upon the subject of study. The goal of partitioning is to create subsets that are distinct, homogeneous or comparable in certain aspects. 

Below are some common partitioning criteria:

1. Range Partition: Data is divided based on a range of values. For example, age range in a demographic study.

2. List Partition: Data is distributed based on a list of values. For example, partitioning customers by their chosen subscription package.

3. Hash Partition: Data is distributed using a hash function, which ensures a uniform distribution of data among partitions. This type is commonly used in database applications.

4. Key Partition: The data is partitioned based on key values–usually using a primary key in a database context.

5. Spatial Partition: In geographical data or image processing, data is partitioned based on spatial coordinates, like longitude and latitude.

6. Time-Based Partitioning: Data is divided based on specific time intervals, such as month, day, year, etc. This is often used in time-series data analysis or back-ups.

7. Balanced Partitioning: Seek to distribute the data evenly across all partitions.

8. Categorical Partitioning: The data is divided based on predetermined categories. For instance, a dataset could be partitioned into categories based on gender, nationality, or occupation.

Please note that their relevance can vary dramatically depending on the context – i.e., their appropriateness is highly dependent on the specific goals and constraints of a project."
2964,2964,96,what is a test,"A test, in software testing, is the act of performing some assurance of both the correctness of a software and its validation of the project requisistes.",whQuestion,"A test is a method or process used to assess someone's knowledge, skills, abilities, or understanding of a particular subject or topic. It usually involves a set of questions, problems, or tasks that are designed to evaluate the test-taker's comprehension or performance in a specific area. Tests can be administered in various formats, including written exams, oral examinations, practical assessments, online quizzes, or standardized tests. The results of a test are typically used to measure an individual's proficiency, identify areas of strength or weakness, make educational or employment decisions, and provide feedback for improvement.","A test is an examination or assessment intended to measure a person's knowledge, skills, aptitude or physical fitness. It can also refer to a procedure intended to establish the quality, performance, or reliability of something, such as a product, process, experiment or medical screening."

It is a detailed step-by-step description of the specific actions to be taken, expected results, and any prerequisites for executing the test. Test cases are designed to uncover any defects or errors in the software and verify that it meets the specified requirements. They are executed by testers during software testing to validate the behavior of the system under different scenarios.","A test case is a set of conditions or variables under which a tester will determine whether a system under test satisfies requirements or works correctly. It includes specific inputs, actions, predicted responses, or expected outcomes to ensure the functionality of a software or application. These test cases are often part of a detailed testing plan or a test script."
1111,1111,154,What is a software inconsistency defect,A software defect or bug is a condition in a software product which doesn’t meet a software requirement or end-user expectation.,whQuestion,"A software inconsistency defect refers to a type of software defect or bug where there is an inconsistency or discrepancy in the behavior or output of a software application. It means that the software does not behave in a consistent or expected manner across different scenarios or inputs.

This defect often occurs when there is a lack of uniformity in the software's design, logic, or implementation. It can manifest as contradictory error messages, unexpected behavior, or incorrect results presented to the user. Software inconsistency defects can result from coding errors, design flaws, or the failure to test and validate the software thoroughly.

These defects are problematic as they can lead to confusion, usability issues, and potential security vulnerabilities. It is vital for software developers and testers to identify and rectify software inconsistency defects through meticulous testing, code review, and quality assurance processes.","A software inconsistency defect, also known as a software bug or error, is a problem or discrepancy within a software program that produces unexpected results or behaviors. This could be caused by a variety of issues such as incorrect code, flawed logic, or miscommunication between different elements of the program. The inconsistency might result in performance problems, unexpected functionalities, or even crashes, which can disrupt the usability and functionality of the software application."
1558,1558,193,what is is a fault,"Fault is an incorrect step, process, or data definition in computer program. Fault is the formal name of a bug.",whQuestion,"A fault is a break or fracture along which rocks on either side have moved relative to each other. It is a type of geological feature that is commonly observed on the Earth's surface and can range in size from small cracks to large-scale fault lines that extend for several kilometers. Faults are primarily formed due to tectonic forces, such as the movement of Earth's tectonic plates, and can lead to earthquakes and the creation of various landforms, such as mountains and valleys.","In geology, a fault is a fracture or zone of fractures between two blocks of rock, which enables them to move relative to one another. This movement can cause earthquakes or, over time, larger geological changes. 

In other contexts, a fault can refer to a defect or malfunction in a machine or plan, or the responsibility for a mistake or wrongdoing."
1106,1106,154,What is a feature omission error,An error is a state of execution of the program which is not expected and may lead to an incorrect result.,whQuestion,"A feature omission error refers to a mistake or oversight in the design or development process of a product or software, where a particular feature or functionality is unintentionally left out or not included when it should be. As a result, users may not be able to perform certain tasks or access necessary functions, leading to a diminished user experience or decreased product effectiveness. Feature omission errors can occur due to various reasons, such as miscommunication, lack of user research, time or budget constraints, or simply human error. It is important for developers and designers to thoroughly test and validate their products to identify and rectify any feature omission errors before release.","A feature omission error refers to a mistake made when certain important features or details are left out in a model, system, or data analysis. This can lead to inaccurate, incomplete, or biased results because the missing information could hold significant influences or insights. It often occurs due to oversight, incomplete data collection, or misjudgment in determining the relevance of features."
1229,1229,160,what is a equivalence partitioning,"Equivalence partitioning is a functional testing criterion that involves partitioning the input domain into a collection of subsets (or equivalent classes). Data in each partition must behave the same way therefore only one condition needs to be tested. Similarly, if one condition in a partition doesn’t work, then none of the others will work.",whQuestion,"Equivalence partitioning is a software testing technique used to divide a set of test cases into smaller groups or partitions based on the assumption that if one test case in a partition is representative and valid, then all the other test cases in that partition would be representative and valid as well. 

The purpose of equivalence partitioning is to reduce the number of test cases required to achieve a certain level of coverage, while still ensuring that all relevant scenarios are tested. It helps in finding defects or errors within the partition boundaries and ensures maximum test coverage with minimum effort.

Equivalence partitioning is commonly used when dealing with inputs that fall into different ranges or categories, such as numerical values, dates, or inputs with specific constraints. By selecting one representative test case from each partition, testers can gain confidence in the system's behavior and ensure that it handles all possible scenarios effectively.","Equivalence Partitioning is a software testing technique that divides the input data of a software unit into partitions of equivalent data from which test cases can be derived. In principle, test cases are designed to cover each partition at least once. This technique is used to reduce the total number of test cases to a finite set of testable test cases, still guaranteeing that they cover all possible scenarios."
369,369,121,what is successful test case,"A test case is composed by the test input, the execution conditions and the expected output to be produced by the program.",whQuestion,"A successful test case is one that produces the expected result or outcome. It verifies that a particular functionality or requirement is working correctly. Additionally, a successful test case is one that is well-defined, easy to understand, and provides sufficient coverage of the functionality being tested. It should be repeatable, meaning that it can be executed multiple times with the same results. A successful test case also provides clear and concise documentation of the steps to be followed, the expected outcome, and any inputs or conditions required for the test.",A successful test case is one that has been executed and meets the expected outcome without any errors or failures. It validates the correctness of the application or system under test and aligns with the defined requirements or specifications.
620,620,134,what is functional testing,"Functional testing (or Black Box Testing) is a technique whereby the system is tested against the functional requirements/specifications. During the functional testing the internal logic of the system being tested is not known to the tester. Functional testing ensures that the requirements are properly satisfied by the system. This type of testing is not concerned with how processing occurs, but rather, with the results of processing. It simulates actual system usage but does not make any system structure assumptions. Functional testing is normally performed during the levels of System Testing and Acceptance Testing.",whQuestion,"Functional testing is a type of software testing that aims to ensure that the software application performs its intended functions correctly. It involves testing the specific features and functionalities of the application to verify that they work as expected. 

The purpose of functional testing is to validate the different functional requirements and business processes of the software. It primarily focuses on ensuring that the application meets the specifications and requirements defined by the client or business.

Functional testing involves testing various aspects such as the user interface, input/output operations, data manipulation, and interactions with other system components. It can be conducted manually or through automated testing tools, depending on the complexity of the software application.

Some common types of functional testing include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. These tests are designed to identify defects and ensure that the software application performs its desired functions accurately and reliably.","Functional testing is a type of software testing that evaluates the performance of specific functions of a system, application, or software. This involves testing user interfaces, APIs, databases, client/server communications and other functionalities. The main purpose is to ensure that the application is functioning as expected and the users can use its functionalities without any issues. This testing checks user requirements and needs, is driven by black box testing where the internal logic of the system being tested is not known by the tester."
