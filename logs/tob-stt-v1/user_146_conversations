Seeker: Hi
TOB-STT: Hello, ask me a question!
Seeker: How old are you
TOB-STT: I am basically a child… But I know very much!
Seeker: DO you like anime
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: What is the meaning of error
TOB-STT: An error is a state of execution of the program which is not expected and may lead to an incorrect result.
Seeker: Who is your creator
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: GOod morning
TOB-STT: Hello, ask me a question!
Seeker: what is omission failure
TOB-STT: A failure is a result of the program which is incorrect or not expected. This is caused by an error.
Seeker: what is fault
TOB-STT: Fault is an incorrect step, process, or data definition in computer program. Fault is the formal name of a bug.

Seeker: what is a defect
TOB-STT: A software defect or bug is a condition in a software product which doesn’t meet a software requirement or end-user expectation.
Seeker: what is output
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what is a state
TOB-STT: It is a criteria within functional testing, but I still don’t have enough knowledge about that, sorry…
Seeker: no problem
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what is test case
TOB-STT: A test case is composed by the test input, the execution conditions and the expected output to be produced by the program.
Seeker: what is a test set
TOB-STT: The test set is composed by several test cases that are used in a software testing activity.
Seeker: what is oracle problem
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what is an oracle
TOB-STT: An oracle is any human or mechanical agent that decides whether a program behaved correctly in a given test and accordingly results in a verdict of “pass” or “fail.” There exist many different kinds of oracles; for example, unambiguous requirements specifications, behavioral models, and code annotations. Automation of mechanized oracles can be difficult and expensive.
Seeker: what is structural testing
TOB-STT: Structural testing (or White-Box testing) is a technique in which tests are derived from the knowledge of the software's structure or internal implementation. That way, the testing professional is able to check if a specific part of the code is correct. Unit testing is an instance of structural testing.
Seeker: what is functional testing
TOB-STT: Functional testing (or Black Box Testing) is a technique whereby the system is tested against the functional requirements/specifications. During the functional testing the internal logic of the system being tested is not known to the tester. Functional testing ensures that the requirements are properly satisfied by the system. This type of testing is not concerned with how processing occurs, but rather, with the results of processing. It simulates actual system usage but does not make any system structure assumptions. Functional testing is normally performed during the levels of System Testing and Acceptance Testing.

Seeker: what is unit testinfg
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what is unit testing
TOB-STT: Unit testing verifies the functioning in isolation of software elements that are separately testable. Depending on the context, these could be the individual subprograms or a larger component made of highly cohesive units. Typically, unit testing occurs with access to the code being tested and with the support of supporting tools. The programmers who wrote the code typically, but not always, conduct unit testing.
Seeker: what is integration testing
TOB-STT: Integration testing is the process of verifying the interactions among software components. Classical integration testing strategies, such as top-down and bottom-up, are often used with hierarchically structured software.
Seeker: when does integration testing occur
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?

Seeker: what is equivalence partiotioning
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what is equivalence partitioning
TOB-STT: Equivalence partitioning is a functional testing criterion that involves partitioning the input domain into a collection of subsets (or equivalent classes). Data in each partition must behave the same way therefore only one condition needs to be tested. Similarly, if one condition in a partition doesn’t work, then none of the others will work.
Seeker: what is test adequacy
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what is sufficient test
TOB-STT: A test, in software testing, is the act of performing some assurance of both the correctness of a software and its validation of the project requisistes.
Seeker: what is sufficient testing
TOB-STT: Software testing is an activity of software engineering whose main goal is to validate the project requisites and to assert the software correctness, both before the deployment of the final product as well as during its maintenaice.
