Seeker: What is software testing
TOB-STT: Software testing is an activity of software engineering whose main goal is to validate the project requisites and to assert the software correctness, both before the deployment of the final product as well as during its maintenaice.
Seeker: What is a failure
TOB-STT: A failure is a result of the program which is incorrect or not expected. This is caused by an error.
Seeker: What the difference between failure and error

Seeker: what is defect
TOB-STT: A software defect or bug is a condition in a software product which doesn’t meet a software requirement or end-user expectation.

Seeker: How do I apply equivalence class partitioning criteria
TOB-STT: The equivalence partitioning criterion divides the input domain in several subsets (partitions) with no intersection and selects a test case for each partition. The idea is that each test case represents all input domain that partition class and, therefore, one test case for each class is enough for this testing criterion. The criterion considers valid and invalid equivalence classes. For example, you can separate invalid and valid inputs into two different subsets or classes.
Seeker: What the difference between fault and error
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: What is the difference between fault and error
TOB-STT: Fault is an incorrect step, process, or data definition in computer program. Fault is the formal name of a bug. An error is a state of execution of the program which is not expected and may lead to an incorrect result.
