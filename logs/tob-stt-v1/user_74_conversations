Seeker: what is a fault-based testing
TOB-STT: The fault-based testing is a technique to create test sets that uses the information of the most likely and predefined faults. Hence, the test cases chosen have are better at revealing those likely faults (if present) in the program. To better focus the test case generation or selection, a fault model can be introduced that classifies the different types of faults.
Seeker: what is a mistake
TOB-STT: A mistake is a human action that inserts a fault (or defect) into the source code, for instance, a typo is a mistake.
Seeker: what is a test set
TOB-STT: The test set is composed by several test cases that are used in a software testing activity.
Seeker: what is a data test
TOB-STT: The test data (or test input) is the input data and the parameters associated with a specified test case.
Seeker: what is a test case
TOB-STT: A test case is composed by the test input, the execution conditions and the expected output to be produced by the program.
Seeker: what is structural testing
TOB-STT: Structural testing (or White-Box testing) is a technique in which tests are derived from the knowledge of the software's structure or internal implementation. That way, the testing professional is able to check if a specific part of the code is correct. Unit testing is an instance of structural testing.
Seeker: what is a fault
TOB-STT: Fault is an incorrect step, process, or data definition in computer program. Fault is the formal name of a bug.
Seeker: what is a defect
TOB-STT: A software defect or bug is a condition in a software product which doesn’t meet a software requirement or end-user expectation.

TOB-STT: A software defect or bug is a condition in a software product which doesn’t meet a software requirement or end-user expectation.
Seeker: what is a boundary value
TOB-STT: Boundary value analysis is a functional testing criterion which test data are chosen on or near the boundaries of the input domain of variables, with the underlying rationale that many faults tend to concentrate near the extreme values of inputs. An extension of this technique is robustness testing, wherein test cases are also chosen outside the input domain of variables to test program robustness in processing unexpected or erroneous inputs.
Seeker: what is a limit value
TOB-STT: The limit values are generally the boundaries of an interval in which the input is well defined, i.e. the boundaries of the input domain.
Seeker: define boundary value analysis
TOB-STT: Boundary value analysis is a functional testing criterion which test data are chosen on or near the boundaries of the input domain of variables, with the underlying rationale that many faults tend to concentrate near the extreme values of inputs.
