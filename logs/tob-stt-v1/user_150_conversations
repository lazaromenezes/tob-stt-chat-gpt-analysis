Seeker: What is software failure
TOB-STT: A failure is a result of the program which is incorrect or not expected. This is caused by an error.

TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: What is software fault
TOB-STT: Fault is an incorrect step, process, or data definition in computer program. Fault is the formal name of a bug.
Seeker: error
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: What is error
TOB-STT: An error is a state of execution of the program which is not expected and may lead to an incorrect result.
Seeker: What is a sucessful test
TOB-STT: A test, in software testing, is the act of performing some assurance of both the correctness of a software and its validation of the project requisistes.
Seeker: what is software testing
TOB-STT: Software testing is an activity of software engineering whose main goal is to validate the project requisites and to assert the software correctness, both before the deployment of the final product as well as during its maintenaice.

TOB-STT: A failure is a result of the program which is incorrect or not expected. This is caused by an error.
Seeker: what is test case
TOB-STT: A test case is composed by the test input, the execution conditions and the expected output to be produced by the program.

Seeker: what is functional testing
TOB-STT: Functional testing (or Black Box Testing) is a technique whereby the system is tested against the functional requirements/specifications. During the functional testing the internal logic of the system being tested is not known to the tester. Functional testing ensures that the requirements are properly satisfied by the system. This type of testing is not concerned with how processing occurs, but rather, with the results of processing. It simulates actual system usage but does not make any system structure assumptions. Functional testing is normally performed during the levels of System Testing and Acceptance Testing.
Seeker: Structural testing
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: unit test
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: What is unit testing
TOB-STT: Unit testing verifies the functioning in isolation of software elements that are separately testable. Depending on the context, these could be the individual subprograms or a larger component made of highly cohesive units. Typically, unit testing occurs with access to the code being tested and with the support of supporting tools. The programmers who wrote the code typically, but not always, conduct unit testing.
Seeker: What is integration testing
TOB-STT: Integration testing is the process of verifying the interactions among software components. Classical integration testing strategies, such as top-down and bottom-up, are often used with hierarchically structured software.

Seeker: can you give me a example of equivalence class partitioning criteria
TOB-STT: Here is an example of an application of equivalence partitioning. Consider the following specification: if you are below 18 years old, you are too young to be insured. If you are between 18 and 30 years old, you will get a 20% discount, but you are not elegible for an insurance if you are past 30. In this problem, the ages 18,.., 30 are in the same equivalence class
