Seeker: hi
TOB-STT: Hi there, what do you need?
Seeker: hi
TOB-STT: Welcome!
Seeker: what is software testing
TOB-STT: Software testing is an activity of software engineering whose main goal is to validate the project requisites and to assert the software correctness, both before the deployment of the final product as well as during its maintenaice.
Seeker: what does software testing consists of
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what makes up software testing
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: when is a test successful
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: how do i apply

Seeker: how do i apply a test case
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: how do i use test case
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what error
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what is error
TOB-STT: An error is a state of execution of the program which is not expected and may lead to an incorrect result.
Seeker: what is failure
TOB-STT: A failure is a result of the program which is incorrect or not expected. This is caused by an error.
Seeker: when is a state in error
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what is sequence
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: no
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what is test case
TOB-STT: A test case is composed by the test input, the execution conditions and the expected output to be produced by the program.
Seeker: can you give me an example of test coverage
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: goodbye
TOB-STT: Nice talking to you!
Seeker: what is oracle
TOB-STT: An oracle is any human or mechanical agent that decides whether a program behaved correctly in a given test and accordingly results in a verdict of “pass” or “fail.” There exist many different kinds of oracles; for example, unambiguous requirements specifications, behavioral models, and code annotations. Automation of mechanized oracles can be difficult and expensive.
Seeker: what is oracle problem
