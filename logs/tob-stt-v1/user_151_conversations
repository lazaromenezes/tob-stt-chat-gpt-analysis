TOB-STT: Hi there, what do you need?
Seeker: Software testing consists of the dynamic verification that a program provides expected behaviors on an infinite set of test cases, suitably selected from the usually finite execution domain However, one of the most important limitations of software testing is that testing can show only the presence of failures, not their absence. This is a fundamental, theoretical limitation; generally speaking, the problem of finding all failures in a program is undecidable. Testers often call a successful (or effective) test one that finds an error. In software testing, the following terms are employed:

Seeker: What is software testing
TOB-STT: Software testing is an activity of software engineering whose main goal is to validate the project requisites and to assert the software correctness, both before the deployment of the final product as well as during its maintenaice.

TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: do you define software faul

Seeker: In software testing what is software failure
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: What is Software Failure
TOB-STT: A failure is a result of the program which is incorrect or not expected. This is caused by an error.
Seeker: what is is Software Fault
TOB-STT: Fault is an incorrect step, process, or data definition in computer program. Fault is the formal name of a bug.
Seeker: what is is Software Error
TOB-STT: An error is a state of execution of the program which is not expected and may lead to an incorrect result.
Seeker: what is is faults in software
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: faults in software

Seeker: What is the practical problem associated with software testing
TOB-STT: Software testing is an activity of software engineering whose main goal is to validate the project requisites and to assert the software correctness, both before the deployment of the final product as well as during its maintenaice.
Seeker: What is the practical problem associated with software test
TOB-STT: A test, in software testing, is the act of performing some assurance of both the correctness of a software and its validation of the project requisistes.
Seeker: what is is Structural testing
TOB-STT: Structural testing (or White-Box testing) is a technique in which tests are derived from the knowledge of the software's structure or internal implementation. That way, the testing professional is able to check if a specific part of the code is correct. Unit testing is an instance of structural testing.
Seeker: what is is Functional testing
TOB-STT: Functional testing (or Black Box Testing) is a technique whereby the system is tested against the functional requirements/specifications. During the functional testing the internal logic of the system being tested is not known to the tester. Functional testing ensures that the requirements are properly satisfied by the system. This type of testing is not concerned with how processing occurs, but rather, with the results of processing. It simulates actual system usage but does not make any system structure assumptions. Functional testing is normally performed during the levels of System Testing and Acceptance Testing.
Seeker: wahts is Unit Testing
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what is is Unit Testing
TOB-STT: Unit testing verifies the functioning in isolation of software elements that are separately testable. Depending on the context, these could be the individual subprograms or a larger component made of highly cohesive units. Typically, unit testing occurs with access to the code being tested and with the support of supporting tools. The programmers who wrote the code typically, but not always, conduct unit testing.
Seeker: what is is Integration Testing
TOB-STT: Integration testing is the process of verifying the interactions among software components. Classical integration testing strategies, such as top-down and bottom-up, are often used with hierarchically structured software.

Seeker: hello
TOB-STT: Hello, ask me a question!
Seeker: What are the criteria for a functional test
TOB-STT: A test, in software testing, is the act of performing some assurance of both the correctness of a software and its validation of the project requisistes.
