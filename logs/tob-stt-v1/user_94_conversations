Seeker: What is the difference between an error and mistake
TOB-STT: An error is a state of execution of the program which is not expected and may lead to an incorrect result. A mistake is a human action that inserts a fault (or defect) into the source code, for instance, a typo is a mistake.
Seeker: What is software testing?
TOB-STT: Software testing is an activity of software engineering whose main goal is to validate the project requisites and to assert the software correctness, both before the deployment of the final product as well as during its maintenaice.

Seeker: what is a test case
TOB-STT: A test case is composed by the test input, the execution conditions and the expected output to be produced by the program.
Seeker: what is an oracle
TOB-STT: An oracle is any human or mechanical agent that decides whether a program behaved correctly in a given test and accordingly results in a verdict of “pass” or “fail.” There exist many different kinds of oracles; for example, unambiguous requirements specifications, behavioral models, and code annotations. Automation of mechanized oracles can be difficult and expensive.

Seeker: what is a test
TOB-STT: A test, in software testing, is the act of performing some assurance of both the correctness of a software and its validation of the project requisistes.
Seeker: what is functional testing
TOB-STT: Functional testing (or Black Box Testing) is a technique whereby the system is tested against the functional requirements/specifications. During the functional testing the internal logic of the system being tested is not known to the tester. Functional testing ensures that the requirements are properly satisfied by the system. This type of testing is not concerned with how processing occurs, but rather, with the results of processing. It simulates actual system usage but does not make any system structure assumptions. Functional testing is normally performed during the levels of System Testing and Acceptance Testing.
Seeker: What is stress testing
TOB-STT: Stress testing exercises software at the maximum design load, as well as beyond it, with the goal of determining the behavioral limits, and to test defense mechanisms in critical systems.
Seeker: What is an equivalent class
TOB-STT: I don't know how to respond this
Seeker: What is an equivalence class
TOB-STT: An equivalency class represents a set of valid and invalid states for the input conditions. For example, if your input must be a number N between 1 and 100, then one (invalid) equivalency class is the set of numbers less than one, another (invalid) equivalency class is the set of numbers greater than 100 and the third (valid) is the set of numbers between 1 and 100.
