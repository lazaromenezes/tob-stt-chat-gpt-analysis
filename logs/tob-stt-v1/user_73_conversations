Seeker: what is functional testing
TOB-STT: Functional testing (or Black Box Testing) is a technique whereby the system is tested against the functional requirements/specifications. During the functional testing the internal logic of the system being tested is not known to the tester. Functional testing ensures that the requirements are properly satisfied by the system. This type of testing is not concerned with how processing occurs, but rather, with the results of processing. It simulates actual system usage but does not make any system structure assumptions. Functional testing is normally performed during the levels of System Testing and Acceptance Testing.

Seeker: what is an error
TOB-STT: An error is a state of execution of the program which is not expected and may lead to an incorrect result.

Seeker: what is a oracle
TOB-STT: An oracle is any human or mechanical agent that decides whether a program behaved correctly in a given test and accordingly results in a verdict of “pass” or “fail.” There exist many different kinds of oracles; for example, unambiguous requirements specifications, behavioral models, and code annotations. Automation of mechanized oracles can be difficult and expensive.

Seeker: tell me an example of equivalence partitioning
TOB-STT: Here is an example of an application of equivalence class partitioning. Consider the following specification: a switch is turned off when the temperature falls below 18˚C and is turned on again when it begomes greater than 21˚C. In this problem, some equivalence values belonging to the same classes are 22, 23 and 24.
Seeker: what is a mistake
TOB-STT: A mistake is a human action that inserts a fault (or defect) into the source code, for instance, a typo is a mistake.

TOB-STT: Suppose you have a program in which the user has to create a password with length between 6 and 12. So the test cases generated for this program, using the boundary value analysis technique, would be for passwords with lengths 5, 6, 12 and 13.

TOB-STT: Here is an example of an application of equivalence class partitioning. Consider the following specification: if you are below 18 years old, you are too young to be insured. If you are between 18 and 30 years old, you will get a 20% discount, but you are not elegible for an insurance if you are past 30. In this problem, the ages 18,.., 30 are in the same equivalence class
