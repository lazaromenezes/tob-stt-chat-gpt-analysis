TOB-STT: In functional testing technique, the functionality of an application is tested by providing inputs to generate the desired outputs. Consider a bus ticket purchase system with the following requirement: The discount amount is calculated as follows: students can purchase up to 100 tickets per month, with a 50% discount; workers can buy up to 50 tickets a month, with a 30% discount; other users do not have discount on the ticket price. The functional testing concentrates in selection of test input (or data test) to test this functionality, for instance, selecting test input for each class of user of the bus (student, worker and others).

Seeker: Can you give me an example of equivalence partitioning
TOB-STT: I don't know how to respond this
Seeker: Give example of equivalence partitioning
TOB-STT: Here is an example of an application of equivalence class partitioning. Consider the following specification: if you are below 18 years old, you are too young to be insured. If you are between 18 and 30 years old, you will get a 20% discount, but you are not elegible for an insurance if you are past 30. In this problem, the ages 18,.., 30 are in the same equivalence class
