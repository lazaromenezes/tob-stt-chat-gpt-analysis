Seeker: what is a error
TOB-STT: An error is a state of execution of the program which is not expected and may lead to an incorrect result.
Seeker: what is a fault
TOB-STT: Fault is an incorrect step, process, or data definition in computer program. Fault is the formal name of a bug.

TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what is a failure
TOB-STT: A failure is a result of the program which is incorrect or not expected. This is caused by an error.
Seeker: what is the difference between fault and error
TOB-STT: Fault is an incorrect step, process, or data definition in computer program. Fault is the formal name of a bug. An error is a state of execution of the program which is not expected and may lead to an incorrect result.

Seeker: Can you give me a example of equivalence class partitioning criteria
TOB-STT:
Seeker: Can you give me a example of equivalence class partitioning criteria
TOB-STT: Here is an example of an application of equivalence partitioning. Consider the following specification: if you are below 18 years old, you are too young to be insured. If you are between 18 and 30 years old, you will get a 20% discount, but you are not elegible for an insurance if you are past 30. In this problem, the ages 18,.., 30 are in the same equivalence class
Seeker: what is a software testing
TOB-STT: Software testing is an activity of software engineering whose main goal is to validate the project requisites and to assert the software correctness, both before the deployment of the final product as well as during its maintenaice.
