9,9,100,Can you give me an example of equivalence class partitioning,Clarify,"Here is an example of an application of equivalence partitioning. Consider the following specification: one of the fields of a form is a text box that accepts numeric values from 18 to 25. For this problem, a value that belongs to an invalid equivalence class is 17, whereas a value belonging to a valid equivalence class is, for instance, 20.","Sorry, I didn't understand your question, could you repeat?"
10,10,100,How do I apply equivalence class partitioning,whQuestion,"The equivalence partitioning criterion divides the input domain in several subsets (partitions) with no intersection and selects a test case for each partition. The idea is that each test case represents all input domain that partition class and, therefore, one test case for each class is enough for this testing criterion. The criterion considers valid and invalid equivalence classes. For example, you can separate invalid and valid inputs into two different subsets or classes.","Sorry, I didn't quite catch that"

1486,1486,183,What is functional testing,whQuestion,"Functional testing (or Black Box Testing) is a technique whereby the system is tested against the functional requirements/specifications. During the functional testing the internal logic of the system being tested is not known to the tester. Functional testing ensures that the requirements are properly satisfied by the system. This type of testing is not concerned with how processing occurs, but rather, with the results of processing. It simulates actual system usage but does not make any system structure assumptions. Functional testing is normally performed during the levels of System Testing and Acceptance Testing.","Functional testing (or Black Box Testing) is a technique whereby the system is tested against the functional requirements/specifications.

Could you ask me differently?","Functional testing (or Black Box Testing) is a technique whereby the system is tested against the functional requirements/specifications. During the functional testing the internal logic of the system being tested is not known to the tester. Functional testing ensures that the requirements are properly satisfied by the system. This type of testing is not concerned with how processing occurs, but rather, with the results of processing. It simulates actual system usage but does not make any system structure assumptions. Functional testing is normally performed during the levels of System Testing and Acceptance Testing."

The functional testing concentrates in selection of test input (or data test) to test this functionality, for instance, selecting test input for each class of user of the bus (student, worker and others).",I don't understand what you mean

During the functional testing the internal logic of the system being tested is not known to the tester. Functional testing ensures that the requirements are properly satisfied by the system. This type of testing is not concerned with how processing occurs, but rather, with the results of processing. It simulates actual system usage but does not make any system structure assumptions. Functional testing is normally performed during the levels of System Testing and Acceptance Testing."

Then, the following paths should be equal to the previous one, but changing the decision of the first predicate node not changed yet. After you cannot add any more paths, you have exactly C paths, where C is the McCabe complexity of your CFG. You should create test cases the exercise this paths.

2054,2054,34,I do not know,Statement,It was a rhetorical question.,"To create a test set using the McCabe criterion, first write down a complete path always making decisions in predicate nodes to avoid loops (or the first path could be the result of a random real input). Then, the following paths should be equal to the previous one, but changing the decision of the first predicate node not changed yet. After you cannot add any more paths, you have exactly C paths, where C is the McCabe complexity of your CFG. You should create test cases the exercise this paths. This test set also has the property that it satisfies statement coverage and branch coverage criterions."

The functional testing concentrates in selection of test input (or data test) to test this functionality, for instance, selecting test input for each class of user of the bus (student, worker and others).","Functional testing (or Black Box Testing) is a technique whereby the system is tested against the functional requirements/specifications. During the functional testing the internal logic of the system being tested is not known to the tester. Functional testing ensures that the requirements are properly satisfied by the system. This type of testing is not concerned with how processing occurs, but rather, with the results of processing. It simulates actual system usage but does not make any system structure assumptions. Functional testing is normally performed during the levels of System Testing and Acceptance Testing."

2557,2557,78,How are you?,whQuestion,I don't know how to respond this,"To create a test set using the McCabe criterion, first write down a complete path always making decisions in predicate nodes to avoid loops (or the first path could be the result of a random real input). Then, the following paths should be equal to the previous one, but changing the decision of the first predicate node not changed yet. After you cannot add any more paths, you have exactly C paths, where C is the McCabe complexity of your CFG. You should create test cases the exercise this paths. This test set also has the property that it satisfies statement coverage and branch coverage criterions."

2632,2632,84,How are you,whQuestion,I don't know how to respond this,"To create a test set using the McCabe criterion, first write down a complete path always making decisions in predicate nodes to avoid loops (or the first path could be the result of a random real input). Then, the following paths should be equal to the previous one, but changing the decision of the first predicate node not changed yet. After you cannot add any more paths, you have exactly C paths, where C is the McCabe complexity of your CFG. You should create test cases the exercise this paths. This test set also has the property that it satisfies statement coverage and branch coverage criterions."

2974,2974,98,How are you,whQuestion,"I am fine, what about you","To create a test set using the McCabe criterion, first write down a complete path always making decisions in predicate nodes to avoid loops (or the first path could be the result of a random real input). Then, the following paths should be equal to the previous one, but changing the decision of the first predicate node not changed yet. After you cannot add any more paths, you have exactly C paths, where C is the McCabe complexity of your CFG. You should create test cases the exercise this paths. This test set also has the property that it satisfies statement coverage and branch coverage criterions."
