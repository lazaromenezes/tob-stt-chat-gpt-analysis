TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: What are the limitations of software testing
TOB-STT: Software testing is an activity of software engineering whose main goal is to validate the project requisites and to assert the software correctness, both before the deployment of the final product as well as during its maintenaice.

Seeker: What is software fault
TOB-STT: Fault is an incorrect step, process, or data definition in computer program. Fault is the formal name of a bug.
Seeker: What is software error
TOB-STT: An error is a state of execution of the program which is not expected and may lead to an incorrect result.
Seeker: What is software failure
TOB-STT: A failure is a result of the program which is incorrect or not expected. This is caused by an error.

Seeker: What is equivalence partitioning
TOB-STT: Equivalence partitioning is a functional testing criterion that involves partitioning the input domain into a collection of subsets (or equivalent classes). Data in each partition must behave the same way therefore only one condition needs to be tested. Similarly, if one condition in a partition doesnâ€™t work, then none of the others will work.
