Seeker: what is an oracle
TOB-STT: An oracle is any human or mechanical agent that decides whether a program behaved correctly in a given test and accordingly results in a verdict of “pass” or “fail.” There exist many different kinds of oracles; for example, unambiguous requirements specifications, behavioral models, and code annotations. Automation of mechanized oracles can be difficult and expensive.
Seeker: example of a equivalence class
TOB-STT: In software testing, an equivalency class could be the set of strings of size less than or equal to 8, for example.

Seeker: What is functional testing
TOB-STT: Functional testing (or Black Box Testing) is a technique whereby the system is tested against the functional requirements/specifications. During the functional testing the internal logic of the system being tested is not known to the tester. Functional testing ensures that the requirements are properly satisfied by the system. This type of testing is not concerned with how processing occurs, but rather, with the results of processing. It simulates actual system usage but does not make any system structure assumptions. Functional testing is normally performed during the levels of System Testing and Acceptance Testing.
Seeker: How do I use functional testing
TOB-STT: It depends of the functional testing criterion used. The most common criteria used in functional testing are equivalence partitioning and boundary-value analysis. Please, ask me how to use equivalence partitioning criterion and/or boundary-value analysis criterion.

Seeker: thank you
TOB-STT: You are welcome! :)
Seeker: bye
TOB-STT: Nice talking to you!

Seeker: what is a fault
TOB-STT: Fault is an incorrect step, process, or data definition in computer program. Fault is the formal name of a bug.
Seeker: what is an error
TOB-STT: An error is a state of execution of the program which is not expected and may lead to an incorrect result.
Seeker: thanks
TOB-STT: You are welcome! :)
