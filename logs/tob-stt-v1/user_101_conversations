Seeker: hi
TOB-STT: Hi there, what do you need?
Seeker: what is software testing
TOB-STT: Software testing is an activity of software engineering whose main goal is to validate the project requisites and to assert the software correctness, both before the deployment of the final product as well as during its maintenaice.
Seeker: what is your name
TOB-STT: I am TOB-STT, a software testing teaching assistant!
Seeker: how can I test my software
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what can you do for me

Seeker: what is an unit test
TOB-STT: A test, in software testing, is the act of performing some assurance of both the correctness of a software and its validation of the project requisistes.
Seeker: what is a functional testing
TOB-STT: Functional testing (or Black Box Testing) is a technique whereby the system is tested against the functional requirements/specifications. During the functional testing the internal logic of the system being tested is not known to the tester. Functional testing ensures that the requirements are properly satisfied by the system. This type of testing is not concerned with how processing occurs, but rather, with the results of processing. It simulates actual system usage but does not make any system structure assumptions. Functional testing is normally performed during the levels of System Testing and Acceptance Testing.
Seeker: what is acceptance testing
TOB-STT: Acceptance testing is a level of software testing where a system is tested for acceptability. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the systemâ€™s compliance with the business requirements and assess whether it is acceptable for delivery.
Seeker: Regression testing
