Seeker: What is software testing
TOB-STT: Software testing is an activity of software engineering whose main goal is to validate the project requisites and to assert the software correctness, both before the deployment of the final product as well as during its maintenaice.

Seeker: What do you know about equivalence partitioning classes
TOB-STT: I don't know how to respond this
Seeker: Could you tell me about equivalent partitioning class
TOB-STT: I don't know how to respond this
Seeker: What is a bug
TOB-STT: A software defect or bug is a condition in a software product which doesn’t meet a software requirement or end-user expectation.
Seeker: Can you tell me what is a bug
TOB-STT: A software defect or bug is a condition in a software product which doesn’t meet a software requirement or end-user expectation.
Seeker: What is equivalence partitioning classes
TOB-STT: I don't know how to respond this
Seeker: What is an equivalence class
TOB-STT: An equivalency class represents a set of valid and invalid states for the input conditions. For example, if your input must be a number N between 1 and 100, then one (invalid) equivalency class is the set of numbers less than one, another (invalid) equivalency class is the set of numbers greater than 100 and the third (valid) is the set of numbers between 1 and 100.

Seeker: What is a white-box testing
TOB-STT: Structural testing (or White-Box testing) is a technique in which tests are derived from the knowledge of the software's structure or internal implementation. That way, the testing professional is able to check if a specific part of the code is correct. Unit testing is an instance of structural testing.
Seeker: What is a defect
TOB-STT: A software defect or bug is a condition in a software product which doesn’t meet a software requirement or end-user expectation.
Seeker: What is boundarie value analysis
TOB-STT: I don't know how to respond this
Seeker: What is boundarie-value analysis criteria
TOB-STT: I don't know how to respond this
Seeker: What is limit value analysis technique
TOB-STT: Boundary value analysis is a functional testing criterion which test data are chosen on or near the boundaries of the input domain of variables, with the underlying rationale that many faults tend to concentrate near the extreme values of inputs. An extension of this technique is robustness testing, wherein test cases are also chosen outside the input domain of variables to test program robustness in processing unexpected or erroneous inputs.
Seeker: What is equivalence class partitioning technique
TOB-STT: Equivalence partitioning is a functional testing criterion that involves partitioning the input domain into a collection of subsets (or equivalent classes). Data in each partition must behave the same way therefore only one condition needs to be tested. Similarly, if one condition in a partition doesn’t work, then none of the others will work.
