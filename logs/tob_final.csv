626,134,[(FROM ANSWERS DROP *)],Clarify,"Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?","To create a test set using the all-nodes criterion for your program, you first need to draw the CFG of it (ask me how to do that if you don’t know yet). Then you have to analyse, for each node of your program, what your input must look like so that this node is executed. For example, if you have an if statement such as ```if(A > 0) print(‘A is positive); ``` in your program, you know that the node corresponding to the ```print``` command will only be executed when ```A``` is positive, and so you must insert at least one test case as such. More complex programs will require a deeper analysis, which most of the times will involve more mathematics skills than software testing ones."

813,147,how are you,whQuestion,"I am fine, what about you","To create a test set using the all-nodes criterion for your program, you first need to draw the CFG of it (ask me how to do that if you don’t know yet). Then you have to analyse, for each node of your program, what your input must look like so that this node is executed. For example, if you have an if statement such as ```if(A > 0) print(‘A is positive); ``` in your program, you know that the node corresponding to the ```print``` command will only be executed when ```A``` is positive, and so you must insert at least one test case as such. More complex programs will require a deeper analysis, which most of the times will involve more mathematics skills than software testing ones."

1641,205,What is functional testing,whQuestion,"Functional testing (or Black Box Testing) is a technique whereby the system is tested against the functional requirements/specifications. During the functional testing the internal logic of the system being tested is not known to the tester. Functional testing ensures that the requirements are properly satisfied by the system. This type of testing is not concerned with how processing occurs, but rather, with the results of processing. It simulates actual system usage but does not make any system structure assumptions. Functional testing is normally performed during the levels of System Testing and Acceptance Testing.","Functional testing (or Black Box Testing) is a technique whereby the system is tested against the functional requirements/specifications.

Functional testing is normally performed during the levels of System Testing and Acceptance Testing."
1642,205,What are the functional testing criteria,whQuestion,"A testing criteria or technique is a set of rules which define the information to be used to create a test set, in order to fulfill some objective. For example, the white-box testing uses the information of the code’s structure to create a test set.","Sorry, I didn't quite catch that"
1643,205,Give me an example of functional testing criteria,Statement,"In functional testing technique, the functionality of an application is tested by providing inputs to generate the desired outputs. Consider a bus ticket purchase system with the following requirement: The discount amount is calculated as follows: students can purchase up to 100 tickets per month, with a 50% discount; workers can buy up to 50 tickets a month, with a 30% discount; other users do not have discount on the ticket price. The functional testing concentrates in selection of test input (or data test) to test this functionality, for instance, selecting test input for each class of user of the bus (student, worker and others).","Sorry, I didn't quite catch that"

1647,205,What is equivalence class partitioning,whQuestion,"Equivalence partitioning is a functional testing criterion that involves partitioning the input domain into a collection of subsets (or equivalent classes). Data in each partition must behave the same way therefore only one condition needs to be tested. Similarly, if one condition in a partition doesn’t work, then none of the others will work.","Sorry, I didn't understand your question, could you repeat?"

1655,207,meu deus hein garoto,Statement,"Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?","To create a test set using the all-nodes criterion for your program, you first need to draw the CFG of it (ask me how to do that if you don’t know yet). Then you have to analyse, for each node of your program, what your input must look like so that this node is executed. For example, if you have an if statement such as ```if(A > 0) print(‘A is positive); ``` in your program, you know that the node corresponding to the ```print``` command will only be executed when ```A``` is positive, and so you must insert at least one test case as such. More complex programs will require a deeper analysis, which most of the times will involve more mathematics skills than software testing ones."

I haven't heard anything like that before.,"To create a test set using the all-nodes criterion for your program, you first need to draw the CFG of it (ask me how to do that if you don’t know yet). Then you have to analyse, for each node of your program, what your input must look like so that this node is executed. For example, if you have an if statement such as ```if(A > 0) print(‘A is positive); ``` in your program, you know that the node corresponding to the ```print``` command will only be executed when ```A``` is positive, and so you must insert at least one test case as such. More complex programs will require a deeper analysis, which most of the times will involve more mathematics skills than software testing ones."

2233,52,Why if I have you?,whQuestion,I don't know how to respond this,"To create a test set using the all-nodes criterion for your program, you first need to draw the CFG of it (ask me how to do that if you don’t know yet). Then you have to analyse, for each node of your program, what your input must look like so that this node is executed. For example, if you have an if statement such as ```if(A > 0) print(‘A is positive); ``` in your program, you know that the node corresponding to the ```print``` command will only be executed when ```A``` is positive, and so you must insert at least one test case as such. More complex programs will require a deeper analysis, which most of the times will involve more mathematics skills than software testing ones."

2545,76,difference of functional testing and structural testing,Statement,"Functional testing (or Black Box Testing) is a technique whereby the system is tested against the functional requirements/specifications. During the functional testing the internal logic of the system being tested is not known to the tester. Functional testing ensures that the requirements are properly satisfied by the system. This type of testing is not concerned with how processing occurs, but rather, with the results of processing. It simulates actual system usage but does not make any system structure assumptions. Functional testing is normally performed during the levels of System Testing and Acceptance Testing. Structural testing (or White-Box testing) is a technique in which tests are derived from the knowledge of the software's structure or internal implementation. That way, the testing professional is able to check if a specific part of the code is correct. Unit testing is an instance of structural testing.","Structural testing (or White-Box testing) is a technique in which tests are derived from the knowledge of the software's structure or internal implementation.
