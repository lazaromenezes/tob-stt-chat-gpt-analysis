Seeker: Hi
TOB-STT: Hello, how are you?
Seeker: I m frustraded with the end of the last GoT episode What about you
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what is a failure
TOB-STT: A failure is a result of the program which is incorrect or not expected. This is caused by an error.
Seeker: what is a fault
TOB-STT: Fault is an incorrect step, process, or data definition in computer program. Fault is the formal name of a bug.
Seeker: what is a failure
TOB-STT: A failure is a result of the program which is incorrect or not expected. This is caused by an error.
Seeker: what is a successful test
TOB-STT: A test, in software testing, is the act of performing some assurance of both the correctness of a software and its validation of the project requisistes.
Seeker: do tests show only presence of failures
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what a test can show
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what is an error
TOB-STT: An error is a state of execution of the program which is not expected and may lead to an incorrect result.
Seeker: what is oracle
TOB-STT: An oracle is any human or mechanical agent that decides whether a program behaved correctly in a given test and accordingly results in a verdict of “pass” or “fail.” There exist many different kinds of oracles; for example, unambiguous requirements specifications, behavioral models, and code annotations. Automation of mechanized oracles can be difficult and expensive.
Seeker: adequacy criteria
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: adequacy
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what is equivalence oartitioning
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what is equivalence partitioning
TOB-STT: Equivalence partitioning is a functional testing criterion that involves partitioning the input domain into a collection of subsets (or equivalent classes). Data in each partition must behave the same way therefore only one condition needs to be tested. Similarly, if one condition in a partition doesn’t work, then none of the others will work.
