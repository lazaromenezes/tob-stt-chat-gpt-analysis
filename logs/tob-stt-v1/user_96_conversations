Seeker: What is boundary value
TOB-STT: Boundary value analysis is a functional testing criterion which test data are chosen on or near the boundaries of the input domain of variables, with the underlying rationale that many faults tend to concentrate near the extreme values of inputs. An extension of this technique is robustness testing, wherein test cases are also chosen outside the input domain of variables to test program robustness in processing unexpected or erroneous inputs.
Seeker: Why use functional testing
TOB-STT: The functional (or black-box) testing is done without considering the internal structure of the program, hence the testers don't have to have any knowledge of the algorithms or programming languages used. Also, the test cases only depend of the specification of the product, so the generation of the test data and the testing activity can be independent of the implementation of the program and can be applied without having an executable version of the code.

TOB-STT: I don't know how to respond this
Seeker: How to use equivalence class partitioning technique
TOB-STT: The equivalence partitioning criterion divides the input domain in several subsets (partitions) with no intersection and selects a test case for each partition. The idea is that each test case represents all input domain that partition class and, therefore, one test case for each class is enough for this testing criterion. The criterion considers valid and invalid equivalence classes. For example, you can separate invalid and valid inputs into two different subsets or classes.
Seeker: How do I apply boundarie value analysis
TOB-STT: I don't know how to respond this
Seeker: How do I apply boundary value analysis
TOB-STT: The boundary-value testing criterion determines the boundaries for input values and selects the extremes of the boundary to generate test cases. For instance, if a program's valid input is a positive number less than 10, then the following test cases will be selected in order to test the boundaries: 0, 1, -1, 10, 9 and 11.

TOB-STT: The boundary-value testing criterion determines the boundaries for input values and selects the extremes of the boundary to generate test cases. For instance, if a program's valid input is a non-negative number less than or equal to 10, then the following test cases will be selected in order to test the boundaries: 0, 1, -1, 10, 9 and 11.

Seeker: WHat is a test case
TOB-STT: A test case is composed by the test input, the execution conditions and the expected output to be produced by the program.
Seeker: What is structural testing
TOB-STT: Structural testing (or White-Box testing) is a technique in which tests are derived from the knowledge of the software's structure or internal implementation. That way, the testing professional is able to check if a specific part of the code is correct. Unit testing is an instance of structural testing.
Seeker: What is an error
TOB-STT: An error is a state of execution of the program which is not expected and may lead to an incorrect result.
Seeker: What is the difference between error and mistake
TOB-STT: An error is a state of execution of the program which is not expected and may lead to an incorrect result. A mistake is a human action that inserts a fault (or defect) into the source code, for instance, a typo is a mistake.

Seeker: What is the meaning of limit value
TOB-STT: The limit values are generally the boundaries of an interval in which the input is well defined, i.e. the boundaries of the input domain.

Seeker: what is equivalence class
TOB-STT: An equivalency class represents a set of valid and invalid states for the input conditions. For example, if your input must be a number N between 1 and 100, then one (invalid) equivalency class is the set of numbers less than one, another (invalid) equivalency class is the set of numbers greater than 100 and the third (valid) is the set of numbers between 1 and 100.

TOB-STT: Equivalence partitioning is a functional testing criterion that involves partitioning the input domain into a collection of subsets (or equivalent classes). Data in each partition must behave the same way therefore only one condition needs to be tested. Similarly, if one condition in a partition doesn’t work, then none of the others will work.

TOB-STT: In functional testing technique, the functionality of an application is tested by providing inputs to generate the desired outputs.

The functional testing concentrates in selection of test input (or data test) to test this functionality, for instance, selecting test input for each class of user of the bus (student, worker and others).
