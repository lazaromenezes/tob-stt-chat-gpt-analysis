Seeker: How do i apply equivalence class partitioning criteria
TOB-STT: The equivalence partitioning criterion divides the input domain in several subsets (partitions) with no intersection and selects a test case for each partition. The idea is that each test case represents all input domain that partition class and, therefore, one test case for each class is enough for this testing criterion. The criterion considers valid and invalid equivalence classes. For example, you can separate invalid and valid inputs into two different subsets or classes.
