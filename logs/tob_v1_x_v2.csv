9,9,100,Can you give me an example of equivalence class partitioning,Clarify,"Here is an example of an application of equivalence partitioning. Consider the following specification: one of the fields of a form is a text box that accepts numeric values from 18 to 25. For this problem, a value that belongs to an invalid equivalence class is 17, whereas a value belonging to a valid equivalence class is, for instance, 20.","Sorry, I didn't understand your question, could you repeat?",0.04575951397418976
10,10,100,How do I apply equivalence class partitioning,whQuestion,"The equivalence partitioning criterion divides the input domain in several subsets (partitions) with no intersection and selects a test case for each partition. The idea is that each test case represents all input domain that partition class and, therefore, one test case for each class is enough for this testing criterion. The criterion considers valid and invalid equivalence classes. For example, you can separate invalid and valid inputs into two different subsets or classes.","Sorry, I didn't quite catch that",0.057073697447776794

This is a fundamental, theoretical limitation; generally speaking, the problem of finding all failures in a program is undecidable.

Consider a bus ticket purchase system with the following requirement: The discount amount is calculated as follows: students can purchase up to 100 tickets per month, with a 50% discount; workers can buy up to 50 tickets a month, with a 30% discount; other users do not have discount on the ticket price. The functional testing concentrates in selection of test input (or data test) to test this functionality, for instance, selecting test input for each class of user of the bus (student, worker and others).",I don't understand what you mean,0.05266570672392845

This type of testing is not concerned with how processing occurs, but rather, with the results of processing. It simulates actual system usage but does not make any system structure assumptions.

The functional testing concentrates in selection of test input (or data test) to test this functionality, for instance, selecting test input for each class of user of the bus (student, worker and others).","Functional testing (or Black Box Testing) is a technique whereby the system is tested against the functional requirements/specifications. During the functional testing the internal logic of the system being tested is not known to the tester. Functional testing ensures that the requirements are properly satisfied by the system.

After you cannot add any more paths, you have exactly C paths, where C is the McCabe complexity of your CFG. You should create test cases the exercise this paths.
