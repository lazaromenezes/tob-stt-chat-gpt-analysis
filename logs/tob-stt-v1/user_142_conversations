Seeker: hello to
TOB-STT: Welcome!
Seeker: how are you
TOB-STT: Great! How are you?
Seeker: fine
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what is software testing
TOB-STT: Software testing is an activity of software engineering whose main goal is to validate the project requisites and to assert the software correctness, both before the deployment of the final product as well as during its maintenaice.
Seeker: define model testing
TOB-STT: Software testing is an activity of software engineering whose main goal is to validate the project requisites and to assert the software correctness, both before the deployment of the final product as well as during its maintenaice.
Seeker: model based testing
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: can you define black box testing
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: can you define fault
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what is falua
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what is fault
TOB-STT: Fault is an incorrect step, process, or data definition in computer program. Fault is the formal name of a bug.
Seeker: what is mutation testing
TOB-STT: Software testing is an activity of software engineering whose main goal is to validate the project requisites and to assert the software correctness, both before the deployment of the final product as well as during its maintenaice.
Seeker: what is mutation
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what is black box
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: can you give me an example of omission fault
TOB-STT: Suppose you have a program that, by the software requirements, should accept names with up to 20 digits, but the software developer reserved only 15 digits in the database. That is a defect in the software definition and can lead to an error.
Seeker: can you give me an example of incorrect fact
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: can you give me an example of stranger Information
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what is a test case
TOB-STT: A test case is composed by the test input, the execution conditions and the expected output to be produced by the program.
Seeker: what is test data
TOB-STT: The test data (or test input) is the input data and the parameters associated with a specified test case.
Seeker: what is test Domain
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what is input domain
TOB-STT: The input domain is a set of values that can be used to execute a certain program. The input domain specifies all the possible sets of values.
Seeker: what is inconsistent information
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: can you give me an example of inconsistent information
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
