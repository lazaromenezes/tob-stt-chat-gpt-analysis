Seeker: what is software failure
TOB-STT: A failure is a result of the program which is incorrect or not expected. This is caused by an error.
Seeker: what is software error
TOB-STT: An error is a state of execution of the program which is not expected and may lead to an incorrect result.

Seeker: what is omission error
TOB-STT: An error is a state of execution of the program which is not expected and may lead to an incorrect result.
Seeker: What is a feature omission error
TOB-STT: An error is a state of execution of the program which is not expected and may lead to an incorrect result.
Seeker: You can give the example of omission error
TOB-STT: An example of an error could be the access of some unintended position of a vector, which would case a segmentation fault and stop the execution of the program.
Seeker: What is a strange information error
TOB-STT: An error is a state of execution of the program which is not expected and may lead to an incorrect result.

TOB-STT: An error is a state of execution of the program which is not expected and may lead to an incorrect result.
Seeker: ou can give the example of information error
TOB-STT: An example of an error could be the access of some unintended position of a vector, which would case a segmentation fault and stop the execution of the program.
Seeker: What is a software inconsistency defect
TOB-STT: A software defect or bug is a condition in a software product which doesn’t meet a software requirement or end-user expectation.

Seeker: What is the difference between fault and error
TOB-STT: Fault is an incorrect step, process, or data definition in computer program. Fault is the formal name of a bug. An error is a state of execution of the program which is not expected and may lead to an incorrect result.
Seeker: Can you give me an example of failure
TOB-STT:
Seeker: Can you give me an example of fault
TOB-STT: A defect is an incorrect data definition. In your code, it could be an access of inexistent position in a vector, for instance.

Seeker: Can you give me a example of error
TOB-STT: Suppose you have a program that calculates the factorial of some input integer, but this program uses integers instead of long integers. An error would occur if you input some number that would cause an overflow in the program.
Seeker: Can you give me a example of fault
TOB-STT: A defect is an incorrect data definition. In your code, it could be an access of inexistent position in a vector, for instance.
Seeker: Can you give me a example of defect
TOB-STT: Suppose you have a program that, by the software requirements, should accept names with up to 20 digits, but the software developer reserved only 15 digits in the database. That is a defect in the software definition and can lead to an error.
