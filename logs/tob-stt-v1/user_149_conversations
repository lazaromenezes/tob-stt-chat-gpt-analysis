Seeker: hello
TOB-STT: Welcome!
Seeker: thanls
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: thanks
TOB-STT: You are welcome! :)

Seeker: What is a software fault
TOB-STT: Fault is an incorrect step, process, or data definition in computer program. Fault is the formal name of a bug.

Seeker: hi
TOB-STT: Hi there, what do you need?
Seeker: can you give me an example of a fault]
TOB-STT: A defect is an incorrect data definition. In your code, it could be an access of inexistent position in a vector, for instance.
Seeker: can you give me an example of a error

TOB-STT: A defect is an incorrect data definition. In your code, it could be an access of inexistent position in a vector, for instance.
Seeker: can you give me an example of a error
TOB-STT: Suppose you have a program that calculates the factorial of some input integer, but this program uses integers instead of long integers. An error would occur if you input some number that would cause an overflow in the program.
Seeker: so what is the definition of a error e

Seeker: so what is the definition of a error
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what is a error
TOB-STT: An error is a state of execution of the program which is not expected and may lead to an incorrect result.
Seeker: what is functional testing
TOB-STT: Functional testing (or Black Box Testing) is a technique whereby the system is tested against the functional requirements/specifications. During the functional testing the internal logic of the system being tested is not known to the tester. Functional testing ensures that the requirements are properly satisfied by the system. This type of testing is not concerned with how processing occurs, but rather, with the results of processing. It simulates actual system usage but does not make any system structure assumptions. Functional testing is normally performed during the levels of System Testing and Acceptance Testing.
Seeker: what us structural
TOB-STT: Sorry, I still can't answer that.. Could you ask me differently?
Seeker: what is structural testing
TOB-STT: Structural testing (or White-Box testing) is a technique in which tests are derived from the knowledge of the software's structure or internal implementation. That way, the testing professional is able to check if a specific part of the code is correct. Unit testing is an instance of structural testing.
Seeker: what is fault-based testing
TOB-STT: The fault-based testing is a technique to create test sets that uses the information of the most likely and predefined faults. Hence, the test cases chosen have are better at revealing those likely faults (if present) in the program. To better focus the test case generation or selection, a fault model can be introduced that classifies the different types of faults.
Seeker: what is unit testing
TOB-STT: Unit testing verifies the functioning in isolation of software elements that are separately testable. Depending on the context, these could be the individual subprograms or a larger component made of highly cohesive units. Typically, unit testing occurs with access to the code being tested and with the support of supporting tools. The programmers who wrote the code typically, but not always, conduct unit testing.
Seeker: what is integration testing
TOB-STT: Integration testing is the process of verifying the interactions among software components. Classical integration testing strategies, such as top-down and bottom-up, are often used with hierarchically structured software.
Seeker: what is a failure
TOB-STT: A failure is a result of the program which is incorrect or not expected. This is caused by an error.
Seeker: what is the diference of a fault and an error
TOB-STT: An error is a state of execution of the program which is not expected and may lead to an incorrect result.

Seeker: what is equivalence partitioning
TOB-STT: Equivalence partitioning is a functional testing criterion that involves partitioning the input domain into a collection of subsets (or equivalent classes). Data in each partition must behave the same way therefore only one condition needs to be tested. Similarly, if one condition in a partition doesnâ€™t work, then none of the others will work.

Seeker: define software testing
TOB-STT: Software testing is an activity of software engineering whose main goal is to validate the project requisites and to assert the software correctness, both before the deployment of the final product as well as during its maintenaice.
